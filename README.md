A tiny, unambitious rich text helper for `bevy_ui`.

Inspired by a similar utility in [bevy_jam_template](https://github.com/benfrankel/bevy_jam_template).

## Usage

See [`examples/basic.rs`](./examples/basic.rs).

## Performance

It's probably pretty slow. I doubt you'd want to animate a bunch of text with it.
